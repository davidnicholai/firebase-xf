# Firebase Xamarin.Forms
This repository aims to provide an easy implementation of Firebase authentication (via email and password).

# Getting Started
- Make sure that the neccessary NuGet packages are installed in the solution.
- Just open up the LoginViewModel class and add your API Key inside LoginAsync and RegisterAsync which will come from the Firebase project you had made.
- Register an account using the app and you can log into that account at anytime.
